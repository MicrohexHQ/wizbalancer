This is just a little script I whipped up to make rules for using 
iptables for simple load balancing.

It could be easily modified to do DNAT instead of REDIRECT and such.

Code is ugly, I literally wrote it in under an hour, and it does the job.

See output-example.txt for an idea of what this does.

*** Basic Idea ***
******************

Basically, you have multiple instances of a service listening on its own port,
with each being in sequence with the last.

Then you assign an actual public listening port to it and define the data in
a config file (see config.conf.example).  Then run the script with the config
file name as the only argument.

Run the output so that all of the commands are executed.

Now iptables should take connections to your listen port and balance it to the
other local listening ports you're actually listening on.

It will also remember which IPs connected to which instance of your service and
continue to direct them there, with a timeout of about 12 hours of no activity.

It took me a while to figure out how to do this effectively, and I didn't find
much around the web for details.  So, if anyone else gets some use out of this
at all, then I'm happy.
